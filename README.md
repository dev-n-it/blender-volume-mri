# blender-volume-mri
Blend file setup to convert any mesh into a 3D texture compatible with Godot

Just edit Subject/Mesh inside the file and run the script. It will run for a while and export 128 slices to an "export"-folder next to the blend and then put them together into one texture with 16 columns + 8 rows you can import into Godot
